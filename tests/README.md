# Tests

`tests/run_tests.sh` is the gate: a headless import, then the config, element catalogue,
skeleton, world profile, buildings, dressing, ring drive, bubble, smoke, handling, camera, mission, battery,
thermal, tyre/brake thermal, steering-feel, wear, licence, menu, issue flag, minimap, airborne, reset,
refuel, telemetry watch and first run tests, the driving ones on the tick clock (`--fixed-fps 60`), a few
minutes (the dressing test builds the Ring scene twice; the ring drive test builds the Ring's
road twice and drives 2 km on it twice; the bubble test builds it twice more and drives
700 m of the loop twice, at a tree twice and a teleport (BUBBLE-1; `FD_BUBBLE_PERF=1` in
the environment adds wall-time `perf:` lines to it - the suite never sets it); the
minimap test builds it once more, the reset test twice more and drives 400 m, the telemetry
watch test once more and drives a second on it, the first run test once more for the
dealership and sits the L0 exam twice on the pad; since 4B-7 every Ring scene load also
builds the terrain, the forest walls and the sky, about nine seconds more each; since
BUBBLE-1 the forest build also writes the trunk bodies, a few hundred milliseconds).
`tests/run_tests.sh --parallel` runs the twenty-six tests side by side after the import and
prints the same lines in the same order. What each test checks is in the main
`README.md`.

## Gating a commit, not a working tree

An independent verifier should gate a copy of the committed tree, not the working tree
it happens to stand in:

```
dir="$(mktemp -d)"
git archive HEAD | tar -x -C "$dir"
cd "$dir"
tests/run_tests.sh
```

`git archive` writes out exactly what the commit holds: no uncommitted edit, no
untracked file and no stale `.godot/` cache can pass (or fail) the gate on the
commit's behalf, and nothing the run does - the import writes `.godot/` - touches
anybody's working tree, so it is safe while somebody else is editing or gating there.
The copy has no `.godot/` yet, so its first import is a full one and prints more than a
warm one does; the `== step` markers, the `  ok` lines and the verdicts are the same as
anywhere else. Several copies can be gated at once: the only things the suite writes
outside the project are the smoke test's `/tmp/fd-3R-smoke-<pid>/`, the battery
test's `/tmp/fd-3T-battery-<pid>/`, the wear test's `/tmp/fd-3L-wear-<pid>/`, the
licence test's `/tmp/fd-3K-licence-<pid>/`, the menu test's `/tmp/fd-4A-menu-<pid>/`, the
issue flag test's `/tmp/fd-3IF-issue-<pid>/`, the telemetry watch test's
`/tmp/fd-TW-telemetry-<pid>/` and the first run test's `/tmp/fd-4B6-first-<pid>/` (its
own world.json and cars.json; the data folder's never), one per process each, removed when the
test finishes (the ring drive test writes nothing:
it reads the checked-in skeleton and drape and builds in memory; the buildings test writes
nothing either: it reads the checked-in focus table, and the raw OSM snapshot store only
where it is on the machine, never fetching; the dressing test the same: the checked-in
landcover, the store's raw parts only where they are on the machine, no network, and since
4B-ASSETS-1 the checked-in Blender-authored textures and tree archetypes under `assets/` as
files (since 4B-ASSETS-2 the asphalt set is the Ring's road material too, read through the
project's own imports as the scene loads it) - the suite never runs Blender; regenerating
them is `assets/blender/README.md`'s command; the refuel
test writes nothing: the store is off
headless; the bubble test writes nothing: the Ring in memory, the drives on the tick
clock). No test opens a window or a
native dialog: the garage's folder picker is a GUI path the menu test never takes.
`tests/visual_probe.gd` is not in the suite: the one sanctioned windowed run (the
Conductor's visual probe, `godot --path . --script res://tests/visual_probe.gd
--quit-after 900`), photographing four road-derived spots into `.scratch/fd-visual/`.
